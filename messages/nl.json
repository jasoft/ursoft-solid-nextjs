Timing of Delivery\n- Delivery (i.e. email with download link / license) is typically initiated within **5 minutes** of payment confirmation.\n- In rare cases (e.g. payment system delays or manual review), delivery may take up to **24 hours**.\n- If you do not receive the delivery email within the expected timeframe, please contact our support team (see Sections 8).\n\n### 4. License & Activation\n- For licensed copies, the email will include instructions for activation (e.g. license key, account instructions).\n- Use of the software is subject to our **License Agreement / End-User License Terms**.\n\n### 5. Updates and Upgrades\n- Once delivered, the customer is entitled to download any minor updates or patches for the same major release free of charge (e.g. from version 5.1 to 5.2).\n- Major upgrades (e.g. from version 5.1 to version 6.0) may require the purchase of a separate license or upgrade fee.\n\n### 6. Refunds, Returns & Cancellations\n- While digital licenses are generally non-returnable, we provide a **30-day money-back guarantee** to ensure your satisfaction.\n- If you encounter technical issues or are not satisfied, you may request a refund within **30 days** of purchase, subject to the conditions in our Refund Policy.\n- To request a refund, please contact our support team with your order details. Upon refund approval, you must uninstall the software and destroy all copies of the license key.\n\n### 7. Delivery Issues\n- If the delivery email is not received (e.g. due to spam filters), the customer is responsible for checking spam/junk mail and providing a valid email address.\n- If requested, we will resend the download link or license key.\n- We do not assume liability for delays caused by external factors (e.g. email provider, internet outage).\n\n### 8. Support & Contact Information\nIf you experience any issue with delivery, or have not received your software within the stated timeframe, please contact our support team:\n\nEmail: **support@ursoftware.com**\nSubject line: \"Delivery Issue – Your Uninstaller\"\n\nPlease include your order number, date of purchase, and the email address used for purchase.\n\n### 9. Changes to This Policy\nWe reserve the right to modify this Delivery Policy at any time. The latest version will always be available on our website. Changes will apply to new purchases from the date the revised policy is posted."
