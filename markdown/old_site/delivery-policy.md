# Delivery Policy

## 1. Scope
This Delivery Policy (“Policy”) applies to all customers who purchase licenses or downloads of **“Your Uninstaller”** via our website.

## 2. Delivery Method
- Upon successful payment and order confirmation, the software will be delivered electronically.
- The customer will receive an email containing a download link (or license key / activation instructions), enabling immediate access to the product.
- No physical media (CD/USB) will be shipped unless explicitly specified.

## 3. Timing of Delivery
- Delivery (i.e. email with download link / license) is typically initiated within **5 minutes** of payment confirmation.
- In rare cases (e.g. payment system delays or manual review), delivery may take up to **24 hours**.
- If you do not receive the delivery email within the expected timeframe, please contact our support team (see Section 8).

## 4. License & Activation
- For licensed copies, the email will include instructions for activation (e.g. license key, account instructions).
- Use of the software is subject to our **License Agreement / End-User License Terms**.

## 5. Updates and Upgrades
- Once delivered, the customer is entitled to download any minor updates or patches for the same major release free of charge (e.g. from version 5.1 to 5.2).
- Major upgrades (e.g. from version 5.1 to version 6.0) may require the purchase of a separate license or upgrade fee.

## 6. Refunds, Returns & Cancellations
- Because the product is delivered electronically and becomes immediately accessible, we treat all sales as **final** after delivery.
- We offer a **30-day money-back guarantee**. Refunds or cancellations are only considered within this period, under exceptional circumstances (e.g. we failed to provide a working license key, or there is a proven defect preventing installation).
- To request a refund or report a problem, you must contact our support within **30 days** of delivery, provide proof of purchase, and fully uninstall the software.

## 7. Delivery Issues
- If the delivery email is not received (e.g. due to spam filters), the customer is responsible for checking spam/junk mail and providing a valid email address.
- If requested, we will resend the download link or license key.
- We do not assume liability for delays caused by external factors (e.g. email provider, internet outage).

## 8. Support & Contact Information
If you experience any issue with delivery, or have not received your software within the stated timeframe, please contact our support team:

## 9. Changes to This Policy
